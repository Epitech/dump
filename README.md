# FAQ

### Can I install Fedora first?

Yes, after installing Fedora, perform a [classic installation](https://www.howtogeek.com/197559/how-to-install-windows-10-on-your-pc/) of a [Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) on the machine, make sure that it uses the remaining space and does not delete the Fedora partitions (otherwise, try again).

### After installing Fedora and Windows 10, it starts only on Windows 10, what should you do?

In your BIOS, select the boot order, if a Fedora entry exists, put it first, otherwise the bios will usually suggest creating a custom entry: `\EFI\fedora\grubx64.efi`, don't forget to place this custom entry first in the startup order. This procedure and its necessity depend on the type of computer on which the installation is made.
